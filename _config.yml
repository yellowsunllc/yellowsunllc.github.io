# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This is a sample blog created using Jekyll. On this fictional blog,
  I write about various disparate topics of interest, including coding
  (with a focus on DevOps, Cloud Architecture, and Serverless applications)
  and tabletop gaming (with a focus on Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition and
  various horror and superhero roleplaying games), as well as posting links,
  quotes, and anything else that strikes my fancy.
